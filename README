CGI::Listman 0.04 (apdOp)
=========================

CGI::Listman provides an object-oriented interface to easily manage
web-based subscribtion lists. It implements concepts such as
"dictionaries", "selections", "exporters". It provides some checking
facilities (field duplication or requirements) and uses the DBI interface
so as to provide a backend-independent storage area (PostgreSQL, ...).

Currently only the CSV backend is known to work for storing data. The
MySQL backend support might work but has barely entered alpha stage. Once
it is ready, it will be easy to implement for other SQL databases.

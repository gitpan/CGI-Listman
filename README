CGI::Listman 0.05 (apdOp)
=========================

CGI::Listman provides an object-oriented interface to easily manage
web-based subscribtion lists. It implements concepts such as
"dictionaries", "selections", "exporters". It provides some checking
facilities (field duplication or requirements) and uses the DBI interface
so as to provide a backend-independent storage area (PostgreSQL, ...).

Currently only the CSV and mysql backends are known to work for storing data.
Other database engines might work and will certainly be added later.
